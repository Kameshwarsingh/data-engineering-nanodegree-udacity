## 1 Data Modeling

### 1.1 Relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data 
      Data Modeling using Postgres (Fact and Dimension data model)
      Data Modeling using Apache Cassandra
      When to use and limitations of RDBMS (OLTP, OLAP) or NoSQL data models.

 ## 3 Data Lake
      Why traditional Data warehouse approach does not meet demands of Data scientist and realtime business analytics?
 ### 3.1 Data Lake with Spark
            EMR Cluster Spark, AWS

 ### 3.2 Data Pipeline      
      Data Pipelines with Airflow (DAG, Operators, Hooks), AWS
      Store big data in a data lake and query it with Spark, AWS
      Run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data pipelines in production.
