## Data Modeling

### Relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data 
      Data Modeling using Postgres (Fact and Dimension data model)
      Data Modeling using Apache Cassandra
      Need and justification of - RDBMS (OLTP, OLAP) and NoSQL data models

## Cloud Data Warehouses and Data Lake
    Big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with massive datasets.
    Difference between Data warehouse and Data lake - Business need and justification

### Cloud Data Warehouse
        AWS RedShift
        EMR Cluster Spark
      
 ### Data Lakes
      Data Pipelines with Airflow (DAG, Operators, Hooks)
      Store big data in a data lake and query it with Spark.
      Run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data pipelines in production.
